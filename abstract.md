# Resources for ML and Data Science from Research Computing Services

Research Software Engineering is the approach to make the software used in research more sustainable and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). Research Computing Services at the University of Cambridge hosts a team of RSEs who can advise if you are writing your own software. RCS also hosts the Cambridge System for Data Driven Discovery (CSD3) which comprises a large number of modern CPU and GPU nodes with new hardware being added continually. Software frameworks are provided on CSD3 for common ML and data science applications. Researchers, PIs and their students at the University of Cambridge have access to world class computing resources to further their work at scale.
